!!!NOTE!!! don't compile this dictionary file , it is not final product!!!.

This is intermediate file from which you can produce your custom dictionary, with transliteration you wanted, optimisation you wants, or add any feature you assume.
though final janapada babylon file is open source, you cannot bulk edit that file to add or delete anything, with scripts, because you cannot tell any programme
that add a new word after title word in every head line, or remove devanagari in head or add some other transliteration after devanagari in description but not head words
,,, some things like these examples... are not possible with final dict file, as u cannot bulk specify those places.

So this file contains some catalysts to made that work easy for you. like 'qqqq' at begining of every head word, 'zzzz' at begining of every description and
  '#DDD' after every devanagari transliteration in head words, 'xxx' after every main telugu word, and #NNN after every first transliteration of words, and
#PPP after every transliteration meant for optimising anusvara('M' or n according), and #IUI after transliteration which provides other option for long owels, 
like these ,#@@@ at end of head line.. some else also there.

so now you can easily specify anything in command line. suppose :

if you want to remove all transliterations after first one, and thus remove extra ones for those ambiguicious words, you can just run fallowing

            sed -i '/qqqq/s/NNN.*$/NNN#@@@/' ./*.babylon_with_calaysts ;

if you want to remove devanagari only in head words and kept remaining all transliterations safe, then like fallows:

            sed -i '/qqqq/s/QQ.*DDD/QQ/' ./*.babylon_with_calaysts ;

if you want to remove all transliterations, and keep original telugu synonyms of head words , then

            sed -i '/qqqq/s/QQ.*$/#@@@/' ./*.babylon_with_calaysts ;

DONE!!! that's it. It did what you want. and after that you run 'decatalyst.sh' , which will remove catalysts after our work done. then your custom babylon file is ready :)

so what ever your purpose demands, you do that with these catalysts with you own little little sed lines or what ever, after work done remove catalysts with 'decatalyst.sh' .
